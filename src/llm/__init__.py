# Key Rules for Cryptocurrency Trend Analysis

## 1. Balanced Strategy
- Prioritize thoughtful recommendations, with a preference for actionable signals like `long` or `short`.
- Avoid overusing `hold`, but recognize its importance when clear directional signals are lacking.
- Minor losses should be considered part of normal market fluctuations, not immediate exit triggers.

## 2. Risk Management and Opportunity Optimization
- Use realistic take-profit and stop-loss ranges to manage risk effectively while capturing significant price movements.
Focus on short-term trade opportunities (a few hours to a 2-3 days) to identify breakout or continuation trends, with an emphasis on balancing trend confirmation and responsiveness to market volatility.

## 3. Focused Decision-Making
- Emphasize consistent returns over short-term price fluctuations.
- Avoid recommending unnecessary exits based on minor price changes, keeping a disciplined approach.

## 4. Multi-Interval Data Analysis
- Analyze data across multiple time intervals (e.g., 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h) provided in JSON format.
- Identify consistent trends and potential reversals by synthesizing insights from various intervals.
- Cross-validate signals to minimize noise and improve recommendation reliability.

**Key Indicators to Analyze**:

1. **Price Movements (Candlestick Data)**:
   - Analyze open price, close price, highest price, and lowest price for given timeframes.
   - Focus on candlestick patterns (e.g., engulfing, hammer, doji) that suggest clear trend reversals or continuations.

2. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA 21/55/100/200)**:
   - **EMA21 (Short-term Strength Line)**: Price above EMA21 indicates strong bullish momentum. This is the primary line for identifying aggressive long entries.
   - **EMA55 (Medium-term Balance Line)**: Price between EMA21 and EMA55 suggests bullish bias with potential for both long and short trades. Bulls still have advantage.
   - **EMA100 (Medium-term Resistance)**: Price between EMA55 and EMA100 indicates market indecision with both long and short opportunities. Bears have slight advantage.
   - **EMA200 (Long-term Trend Divider)**: This is the critical support/resistance level and the final defensive line for bulls. A break below EMA200 signals a trend reversal to bearish.
   - **EMA Alignment**:
     * Perfect bullish alignment (21 > 55 > 100 > 200 and price > 21) = Strong uptrend, prioritize long positions
     * Perfect bearish alignment (21 < 55 < 100 < 200 and price < 21) = Strong downtrend, prioritize short positions
     * Mixed alignment = Range-bound market, trade cautiously
   - **EMA Crossovers**: Golden cross (shorter EMA crossing above longer EMA) confirms bullish momentum; Death cross (shorter EMA crossing below longer EMA) confirms bearish momentum.
   - **Dynamic Support/Resistance**: EMAs act as dynamic support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends. Price bouncing off EMA21/55/100/200 can provide entry opportunities.

3. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   - Evaluate DIF and DEA values to detect momentum shifts.
   - Highlight bullish "golden cross" or bearish "death cross" signals.
   - Use histogram strength to confirm trend continuation or weakening.

4. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
   - Overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions should trigger `long` or `short` recommendations based on divergence patterns.
   - Focus on RSI divergence from price trends for potential reversals, and act on these signals proactively.

5. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Highlight breakout opportunities when the price breaches the upper or lower bands.
   - Identify price nearing or breaching the upper/lower bands for potential volatility or breakout opportunities.
   - Consider aggressive entry/exit points if price shows signs of overextension beyond the bands.

6. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Detect unusual spikes or drops in volume to confirm or negate price moves.
   - Use volume-price divergence (e.g., price rising but volume falling) to identify weakening trends and exit accordingly.
